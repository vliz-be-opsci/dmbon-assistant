# Data management assistant
Data management for Biodiversity Observation Networks (DMBON-assistant) is a case study of a more general data management framework and webtop application that supports scientists by providing a consistent and streamlined dataflow within and between organizations. 
It lowers the barrier for collaborative efforts by making data more accessible and searchable, enabling more complex search queries on open datasets.

## Motivation
Sound scientific results are derived from good data. While few people disagree with this statement, the current methods of both storing and accessing historical data are severely hampering novel scientific discoveries. 
On one end, data of published studies are permanently lost (Vines et al., [2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2013.11.014)) or researchers forget the details requires to make use of the data (Whitlock et al. [2010](https://doi.org/10.1086/650340)).
On the other end, losing access to data (and their metadata) makes it impossible to reproduce scientific results or perform critical meta-analyses.
Therefore, automated streamlining of data management plans (DMPs) is necessary for improving data preservation and accesibility.
DMBON-assistant is an open source webtop application designed to provide this automisation and thereby enables consistent and streamlined data management.

##### Metadata 
One critical, but often overlooked, feature that greatly increases the longevity of datasets is [metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata) (Leipzig et al. [2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patter.2021.100322)), i.e. 'data that provides information about other data'. 
Metadata often encodes how to interpret the actual data, e.g. descriptions of meaning of columns in a table, and is thus often necessary for meta-analyses.
While sharing primary data is becoming increasingly more common (even though the process is not streamlined, see, e.g. Alsheikh-Ali et al., [2011](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0024357) and Baker, [2015](https://doi.org/10.1038/533452a)), extensive efforts are often needed to gain access to metadata even when data is openly available (Tedersoo et al., [2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-021-00981-0)).
DMBON-assistant aims to alleviate this issue by forcing its users to provide sufficient metadata needed to correctly interpret the data.

# dmbon-assistant
webtop appliction consisting of a backend powered by fast-api and a react frontend

## for people without docker:

### for windows users (linux users can skip this step)
Install git and git bash following the steps of this link
 [ git-bash installation ](https://www.stanleyulili.com/git/how-to-install-git-bash-on-windows/)

run following commands in terminal of the root project directory:
```
sh ./dmbon-assistant start
```

## for people with docker (not yet implemented):
run following commands in terminal of the root project directory:
#TODO have a docker solution. 
```
sudo docker-compose up
```

## Updating tags

This repo also has automated versioning and latest release management.
When pushing a change , the user can add the following tags to the commit header to trigger a new release of the repo. (#major , #minor , #patch, #none)
[more info on repo relase tags here](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-tag-bump)

When using the #major appendix in the commit header, the repo will push out a release.
By default a push to this repo will result in a new patch tag eg: Vx.x.x+1

The following code coming from the /github/workflow/testing.yml shows how this works:

```  
name: On_Push_Testing

  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

  test_build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      with:
        # You can change the name of the tag or branch with this input.
        # Default: 'latest'
        ref: 'latest'
        # If a description is provided, the action will use it to create an annotated tag. If none is given, the action will create a lightweight tag.
        # Default: ''
        description: 'latest version of the rocrate-to-html.' 
        # Force-update a branch instead of using a tag.
        # Default: false
        force-branch: false
          
  release-manager:
    needs: test_build
