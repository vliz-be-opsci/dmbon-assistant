# Data management assistant
Data management assistant for Biodiversity Observation Networks (DMBON-assistant) is a case study of a more general data management framework and webtop application that supports scientists by providing a consistent and streamlined dataflow within and between individuals and organizations. 
It lowers the barrier for collaborative efforts by making data more accessible and searchable, enabling more complex search queries on open datasets that enrich meta-analyses.
The DMBON-assistant is an important piece of our grander [vision](#our-vision).

[//]: <> (CLEARLY EXPLAIN WHO THIS PROJECT IS FOR)
#### Who is it for?
This project is intended for academics, policy makers, and the general public. 
Academics are encouraged to share their research in a way that makes their research more meaningful and easily citable.
Policy makers benefit from this tool through lowering the barrier for extensive meta-analysis that can shed light on previously unreported correlations.
Finally, the general public benefits from such an open source tool by making academic research more easily accesible to the public.
We believe that open sourcing a project such as this benefits the community and with it we hope to advocate for future open science policies to come.

[//]: <> (VISION)
## Our vision
We believe that discovery relies on open and transparent management of data - following the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/).
Obviously, for this data to be FAIR and thus meaningful, it has to adhere to specific rules such that others can discover and (re-)use the data with little effort.
Ideally, tools should exist such that those that gather data should be able to upload meaningful data without hassle.

**Goals**: \
:heavy_check_mark: Introduce simple and hassle-free procedure for uploading heterogeneous data that conforms to FAIR data management plans. \
:heavy_check_mark: Build a thriving community that aims at open science which promotes simplified sharing and indexing of heterogenous data. \
:heavy_check_mark: Enable complex search queries for meta-analysis.

![Overview of our general vision](docs/images/dmbon-assistant-rocrate-to-pages.png)

### Motivation
Sound scientific results are derived from good data. 
While few people disagree with this statement, the current methods of both storing and accessing historical data are severely hampering novel scientific discoveries. 
On one end, data of published studies are permanently lost (Vines et al., [2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2013.11.014)) or researchers forget the details requires to make use of the data (Whitlock et al. [2010](https://doi.org/10.1086/650340)).
On the other end, losing access to data (and, importantly, their [metadata](#metadata)) makes it impossible to reproduce scientific results or perform critical meta-analyses.
Therefore, automated streamlining of data management plans (DMPs) is necessary for improving data preservation and accesibility.
DMBON-assistant is an open source webtop application designed to provide this automisation, thereby enabling consistent and streamlined data management.

##### Metadata: the overlooked critical component
One critical, but often overlooked, feature that greatly increases the longevity of datasets is [metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata) (Leipzig et al. [2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patter.2021.100322)), i.e. 'data that provides information about other data'. 
Metadata often encodes how to interpret the actual data, e.g. descriptions of meaning of columns in a table, and is thus often necessary for meta-analyses.
While sharing primary data is becoming increasingly more common (even though the process is not streamlined, see, e.g. Alsheikh-Ali et al., [2011](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0024357) and Baker, [2015](https://doi.org/10.1038/533452a)), extensive efforts are often needed to gain access to metadata even when data is openly available (Tedersoo et al., [2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-021-00981-0)).
DMBON-assistant aims to alleviate this issue by assisting its users in providing the sufficient metadata that is needed to correctly interpret the data.

##### Why open source?
As each use case requires specific actions, we lay our trust with the community to further extend DMBON-assistant's functionality with an open source mentality.
We welcome any and all suggestions, feedback, bug reports and general discussion on DMBON-assistant.

# dmbon-assistant
webtop appliction consisting of a backend powered by fast-api and a react frontend

## for people without docker:

### for windows users (linux users can skip this step)
Install git and git bash following the steps of this link
 [ git-bash installation ](https://www.stanleyulili.com/git/how-to-install-git-bash-on-windows/)

run following commands in terminal of the root project directory:
```
sh ./dmbon-assistant start
```

## for people with docker (not yet implemented):
run following commands in terminal of the root project directory:
#TODO have a docker solution. 
```
sudo docker-compose up
```

## Updating tags

This repo also has automated versioning and latest release management.
When pushing a change , the user can add the following tags to the commit header to trigger a new release of the repo. (#major , #minor , #patch, #none)
[more info on repo relase tags here](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-tag-bump)

When using the #major appendix in the commit header, the repo will push out a release.
By default a push to this repo will result in a new patch tag eg: Vx.x.x+1

The following code coming from the /github/workflow/testing.yml shows how this works:

```  
name: On_Push_Testing

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:

  test_build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Bump version and push tag
      uses: anothrNick/github-tag-action@1.36.0
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        WITH_V: true
        DEFAULT_BUMP: patch
    - name: change latest tag
      uses: EndBug/latest-tag@latest
      env:
       GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
       token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      with:
        # You can change the name of the tag or branch with this input.
        # Default: 'latest'
        ref: 'latest'
        # If a description is provided, the action will use it to create an annotated tag. If none is given, the action will create a lightweight tag.
        # Default: ''
        description: 'latest version of the rocrate-to-html.' 
        # Force-update a branch instead of using a tag.
        # Default: false
        force-branch: false
          
  release-manager:
    needs: test_build 
    name: Check if ready for release
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    steps:
      - run: echo ${{ github.event.repository.name }}
        name: Get latest tag of repo 
      - uses: oprypin/find-latest-tag@v1
        with:
          repository: vliz-be-opsci/${{ github.event.repository.name }}  # The repository to scan. Change the part before the / to name or organisation where repo resides
          releases-only: false  # Set to true if you want to know the tag linked to the latest release
        id: vliz-be-opsci  # The step ID to refer to later.

      - run: echo "${{ github.event.repository.name }} is at version ${{ steps.vliz-be-opsci.outputs.tag }}"

        id: regex-match
        with:

          regex: 'v[0-9].0.0'
      - name: Create release
        if: ${{ steps.regex-match.outputs.match != '' }}
        uses: rymndhng/release-on-push-action@master
