## Our vision 
We are a small team and can only do so much.
Furthermore, we also cannot discover and fix all bugs and we can never cover all potential use cases and develop features for them. 
Additionally, we are huge advocates for open science and thus open source projects, such as this one. 
Therefore, we envision to establish a thriving community of users and developers alike.
We hope that this community can both improve and extend the functionality of DMBON-assistant and create a more open and widely used data pipeline.

| :exclamation: | Although we will explain the envisioned workflow with and by contributors below, please note that this workflow can also be changed. This means that any feedback on our envisioned workflow is also of great importance to us!

## Quickstart for developers
Explain, on the meta-level, the ''rules of the game''
* How do we intend to achieve specific things
* What do we **not** do (currently), e.g. 'we currently do not include testing', ...
  * @todo: Make a list of all things we know we should include, but are currently not included
  * @todo: Make the above list into open issues/feature suggestions?

## How can I contribute?

[//]: <> (BUG REPORTS)
#### :bug: Reporting bugs
Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/vliz-be-opsci/dmbon-assistant/issues). 
##### Before submitting a bug report
Before submitting a bug report, please check any (open or closed) issues that raised similar issues. 
If the bug is closely related and yet unsolved, consider adding to that discussion instead of filing a new issue. 
This might help us track down the bug and give priority to bugs that trouble multiple users.

##### How do I submit a useful bug report?
Once you have pinned down a bug, create an issue by providing sufficient information by filling in the provided template that should appear when filing a [new issue](https://github.com/vliz-be-opsci/dmbon-assistant/issues/new/choose).
Please ty to explain the problem clearly and concise and include additional details that might help us reproduce, pin down and fix the problem.
* Use a clear and descriptive title to identify the problem.
* Describe the exact steps you have taken that made you encounter the issue. 
* Describe the behavior that you expected.
* Include details about your configuration, OS, environment, versions, etc. 
* Describe what you have done to try to fix the issue.
* Include screenshots, logs, terminal output, or anything that could help illustrate the issue further.

[//]: <> (NEW FEATURE SUGGESTIONS)
#### :bulb: Suggesting new features 
When using DMBON-assistant you will undoubtedly have many great ideas about possible new features that you think should be included. 

##### Before suggesting new features
Before suggesting a new feature, please check the list of already suggested features. 
Additionally, check if there are already existing libraries that provide the enhancement - no need to reinvent the wheel!

##### How do I submit a (good) feature suggestion?

[//]: <> (YOUR CONTRIBUTION)
### Your contribution
Are you unsure where to start contributing to DMBON-assistant? 
You might be able to contribute by starting browsing through issues or already open feature suggestions.
Below, we go through some ways you can contribute, but please keep in mind that we are open for any other suggestions that are not listed below!

[//]: <> (DOCUMENTATION)
#### :memo: Write documentation
We aspire to provide detailed documentation that describes how to use and modify DMBON-assistant.
If you encounter an opportunity to improve the documentation or fix errors in the documentation, we would be very happy if you did! 

#### :computer: Write example code
We intend to include descriptive example code that illustrates how we believe one should make use of DMBON-assistant.
However, there are only few of us and we can only think (and work out) so many examples. 
Therefore we would be thrilled if you decide to write and document examples, such that new users can get started more easily. 
Please have a look at the given examples for a general template of descriptive example code.


[//]: <> (PULL REQUESTS)
### :wrench: Pull requests
Did you fix a bug, implement a new feature, write documentation, work out a new example, or contributed to such a degree that the codebase should be updated?
If yes, please submit a pull request.

#### CLA assistant
We use [CLA assistant](https://cla-assistant.io/) to automate the process of contributors agreeing with our Contributor License Agreement (CLA).
