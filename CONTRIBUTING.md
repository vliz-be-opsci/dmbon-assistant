## Our vision 
We are a small team and can only do so much.
Furthermore, we also cannot discover and fix all bugs and we can never cover all potential use cases and develop features for them. 
Additionally, we are huge advocates for open science and thus open source projects, such as this one. 
Therefore, we envision to establish a thriving community of users and developers alike.
We hope that this community can both improve and extend the functionality of DMBON-assistant and create a more open and widely used data pipeline.

| :exclamation: | Although we will explain the envisioned workflow with and by contributors below, please note that this workflow is also subjected to change. This means that any feedback on our envisioned workflow is also of great importance to us!

## Quickstart for developers
Explain, on the meta-level, the ''rules of the game''
* How do we intend to achieve specific things
* What do we **not** do (currently), e.g. 'we currently do not include testing', ...
  * @todo: Make a list of all things we know we should include, but are currently not included
  * @todo: Make the above list into open issues/feature suggestions?

[//]: <> (YOUR CONTRIBUTION)
### Your contribution
Are you unsure where to start contributing to DMBON-assistant? 
You might be able to contribute by starting browsing through issues or already open feature suggestions.
Below, we go through some ways you can contribute, but please keep in mind that we are open for any other suggestions that are not listed below!

[//]: <> (DOCUMENTATION)
#### :memo: Write documentation
We aspire to provide detailed documentation that describes how to use and modify DMBON-assistant.
If you encounter an opportunity to improve the documentation or fix errors in the documentation, we would be very happy if you did! 

#### :computer: Write example code
We intend to include descriptive example code that illustrates how we believe one should make use of DMBON-assistant.
However, there are only few of us and we can only think (and work out) so many examples. 
Therefore we would be thrilled if you decide to write and document examples, such that new users can get started more easily. 
Please have a look at the given examples for a general template of descriptive example code.
